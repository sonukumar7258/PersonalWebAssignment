# PersonalWebAssignment
This is a web application project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display information as demo projects and education. The "Projects" page allows users to filter projects by technology, and the "Education" page displays a list of courses. This project was built using Visual Studio Code and self-hosted agents for continuous integration (CI).
